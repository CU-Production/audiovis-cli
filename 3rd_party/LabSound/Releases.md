## alpha 1.2

- rename DelayMode to DelayModel to match spec
- refactor parameter and setting initializaiton for audio nodes to refer to
  AudioParamDescriptors and AudioSettingDescriptors.
- HRTF panner now works for sample rates other than 44.1 khz.
- panners no longer buzz or pop at the end of a sample file

### breaking changes

- AudioNode now takes an AudioNodeDescriptor. Any custom nodes will need a 
  tweak to match the new API. The interface for existing nodes hasn't changed. 
  For reference when updating your own nodes, have a look at any of the built 
  in nodes to see what the descriptor set up looks like.
- PannerNode no longer is responsible for managing the HRTF database
- HRTF database is owned by the AudioContext, and must be explicitly loaded.
- There is no default HRTF database
- Audio parameters constructor changed due to AudioParamDescriptor change.

## v1.1
# 23 October 2022

### Simplified channel management

Simplified channel management by automatically conforming signal processing 
pathways from the leaf nodes. Leaf node channel counts are propagated backwards 
towards the audio context such that intermediate nodes preserve channel counts, 
unless they have an explicit behavior of changing the channel count. 
For example, connecting a stereo source to a gain node will promote a mono gain 
node to stereo. A mono node connected to a stereo panner node will result in a 
stereo output.

### SampledAudioNode rewritten

SampledAudioNode has been rewritten to do it's own compositing when scheduled 
such that many instances play in an overlapping manner. This allows efficiently 
playing dozens of copies of the same sound simultaneously. The new algorithm 
requires less intermediate storage and has a much lower CPU cost. Detuning has 
been improved to allow a greater working range, and higher quality when 
pitching higher. SampledAudioNode no longer has an embedded stereo panning 
node, thus simplifying panning and compositing logic. Scheduling is now sample 
accurate, rather than quantum-accurate, and loop points and loop counts have 
been added.

### WaveShaperNode rewritten

The WaveShaperNode has been rewritten to minimize CPU overhead. Unnecessary
object orient complexity has been deleted.

### Improved threading

Threading and thread safety has been improved. The update service thread is 
nearly empty at this point, as graph modifications are now managed by the 
main update. Communications with other threads now occurs through concurrent 
lockfree queues. Many mutexes are now gone, as well as rare termination races.

### Miscellaneous

- autoconfigure channel counts
- rename BPMDelay.h to BPMDelayNode.h
- rewrite WaveShaper for efficiency
- rewrite SampledAudioNode for efficiency and sample accurate timing
- rewrite resampler for SampledAudioNode for quality and speed
- use concurrent queues to eliminate mutexes in audio callback
- minimize use of maintenance thread
- bulletproof asynchronous connects and disconnects of node wiring
- improved offline context interface
- recorder node can run as a pull node indepdently of device context
- improved miniaudio backend
- numerous Android fixes (by xioxin)

### Releases
------------

## v0.13.0 Release Candidate
# 18 Aug 2019

- AudioSettings. AudioParams already exist for rate varying values on Audio Nodes. AudioParams are registered on nodes by name, and can be looked up by name. Non-rate varying parameters such as filter modes, buffer sizes, and so on could not be similarly looked up by name. AudioSettings are introduced in this release for non-rate varying parameters, such as filter modes, buffer sizes and so on. Settings for each AudioNode are documented in its corresponding header file. A vector of param or setting names can be fetched from an AudioNode and used to populate a user interface. Each fetched AudioSetting can be queried as to whether its last set type was a Uint32 or a Float, in order that user interfaces can self configure appropriately.

- Added some nullchecks to AudioChannel memory management as pointed out by harmonicvision

## v0.12.0 Beta
# 4 Jan 2018

- clean up how AudioNodes are connected to one another. Formerly, the connect(...) method was called directly on an AudioNode, taking the graph lock and effecting changes to the AudioContext itself. This is no longer the case. AudioContext is now the arbiter of all graph changes.

## v0.11.0 Alpha
# 4 Jan 2018

- Numerous bug and maintenance fixes.
- A cmake build system.

## v0.10.0 Alpha
# 2 Jan 2016

- Several breaking API changes related to AudioContext creation and PannerNode initialization.

## v0.9.0 Alpha
# 2 Jan 2016

- Maintenance vs2015
